    <h1 class="h2">About Our Workshop</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our digital workshop, the best place for free-to-play puzzle games designed for young builders. We were founded on a simple belief: that gaming can be a powerful tool for learning and development. Our platform provides fun, accessible challenges that help children build spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills, one project at a time.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>In a world of complex games and apps, we wanted to create a safe haven that makes learning fun. Our mission is to provide a high-quality, curated collection of 3D puzzle and logic games that load instantly in your browser. We focus on providing a seamless experience so kids can focus on what matters—solving the next puzzle and building confidence.</p>

          <li><strong>Safe & Private:</strong> We respect your child's privacy. High scores are stored on your device, and we collect no personal data.</li>

        <h2 class="h2">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p><strong>Quality over Quantity:</strong> We don't aim to have thousands of games. Instead, we hand-pick every title to ensure it is age-appropriate, genuinely fun, and helps develop cognitive skills. Each game is optimized for performance, providing a smooth, frustration-free experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Kid-First Design:</strong> Your child's experience is our top priority. That means clean interfaces, no intrusive ads, and a focus on safety and privacy. Kids Puzzle is here to provide that perfect dose of brain-boosting entertainment. Thank you for being part of our community!</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Meet the Founder</h2>
      <p>This workshop was started by Bob, a builder and parent who saw an opportunity for games to be more than just a distraction. "I wanted to create the kind of site I'd want my own crew to use," Bob says. "A straightforward, honest-to-goodness game site with an educational purpose. No tricks, no hidden costs, just puzzles that make you think. The fact that high scores are stored locally is a core part of that vision—it puts families in complete control of their data."</p>
      <p>This project is a labor of love, built on a foundation of respect for young builders and a passion for the power of play.</p>
